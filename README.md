## Motivation
As the SSR gaining as much traction as they ever have, I wanted to build this project to take advantage of this, and learn `Next.js` aswell as `Chakra-UI`, which is a very customizable CSS component library.
Also this was a very good chance to learn Next-Auth since I have heard very good reviews about it, this plus `Chart.js` were very fruitful additions to the project.

## Tech Stack
`Next.js`, `React`, `Chakra-UI`, `Next-Auth` and `Chart.js`

## Future Improvements
1. I would like to experiment with `React-Query` or `Zustand` in the future, but due to the size of the project, incorporating either would be too overkill for the project
2. The design part **isn't** the focus of this project but nonetheless, having a clearer design in the future would really help me and save me more time, instead of me just using my imaginationâœ¨
3. Experiment with Next.js's [cool stuff](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2)!
